Image classification

This project uses a convolutional neural network composed of multiple convolution layers followed by max-pooling and dropout layers, and finally a fully connected layer for
image classification. It can be used to classify images in 10 different classes and has achieved an accuracy of around 90% on test set. Various Data augmentation techniques have
been applied to increase the size of the training set by creating modified versions of images in the dataset. This helps improve the model's ability to generalize, 
thereby reducing overfitting.
